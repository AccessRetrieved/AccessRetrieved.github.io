For many First Nations people, water also has deep cultural and spiritual significance. Although access to safe and reliable drinking water is easy for most Canadian, many first Nations communities have long been experiencing challenges to accessing safe drinking water, which is exemplified by that the water supplied to many First Nations reserves is often contaminated, hard to access, or at risk due to faulty treatment systems (Galway, 2016; Human Rights Watch, 2016). Government reports, case-study reviews by non-profit organizations and academic research have identified the inequalities in the accessibility to safe drinking water between First Nations communities and other communities across Canada. For example, people living on First Nations reserves are 90 times more likely to be without running water than other Canadians (Morrison et al., 2015). The number of water-borne infections in First Nations communities is 26 times higher than the national average, and “about 30% of reserved-based community water systems are classified as posing a high risk to water quality” (Morrison et al., 2015). The long-standing issue of inadequate access to safe drinking water in First Nations communities is also demonstrated by the large number of drinking water advisories\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eon First Nations water systems across Canada.\u0026nbsp;","type":"paragraph"}},"n-4xL5pM":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"\u003cem\u003eWatch the video \"Canada's Water Crisis: Indigenous Families at Risk\" from Human Rights Watch\u003c/em\u003e","type":"paragraph"}},"n-3e17Js":{"type":"embed","data":{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arnqpnm70Ng","embedType":"video","title":"Canada's Water Crisis: Indigenous Families at Risk","description":"Canada has abundant water, yet water in many indigenous communities in Ontario is not safe to drink, Human Rights Watch said in a new report today.

When a boil water advisory is issued, community members are advised to boil water for one minute prior to use including drinking water, brushing teeth, food preparation, bathing at-risk populations (e.g., infant, toddler, the elderly). In cases where water cannot be boiled, community members often have to purchase commercially packaged water to meet their daily needs. Living under a water advisory can become a significant burden in terms of time and financial resources, particularly during long-term advisories and for those vulnerable populations – children, the elderly, pregnant women, people with disabilities, people with chronic diseases, and low-income families (Galway, 2016, Human Rights Watch, 2016). It has been shown that although the most serve public health concerns like water-borne illness and related deaths were mostly avoided through issuing water advisories, the economic and social costs of drinking water problems among First Nations communities are considerable (Human Rights Watch, 2016). For example, the occurrence of a water advisory can cause businesses and services to close temporarily, which results in the subsequent loss of income. Recurring and lengthy advisories in a community may cause its residents to lose confidence in its drinking water quality, which could make them turn to unsafe alternative sources, such as untreated lake water, even after the advisory is eliminated (Auditor General of Canada, 2021). In addition, it has negatively impacted the culture life of First Nations people and contributed to the severe housing shortage on reserves (Human Rights Watch, 2016).\u0026nbsp;"}},"n-ZTkskv":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"\u003cstrong\u003eCase Study: The Mercury Poisoning in the Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong Communities\u003c/strong\u003e","type":"large-paragraph"}},"n-cxQjmp":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"From the 1960s to the early 1970s, a chemical plant at the Reed Paper mill in Dryden, Ont., which is upstream of the Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong communities, dumped 9,000 kilograms of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River (CBC News, 2021).","type":"paragraph"},"config":{"size":"wide"}},"n-f20y8q":{"type":"immersive-narrative-panel","data":{"panelStyle":"themed"},"children":["n-cxQjmp"]},"n-V6coxV":{"type":"webmap","data":{"map":"r-324d495407554a5b9857f2ff8534d15a","caption":"Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations","extent":{"spatialReference":{"latestWkid":3857,"wkid":102100},"xmin":-10731655.76503888,"ymin":6288480.817981991,"xmax":-10148899.861392977,"ymax":6616242.795268669},"center":{"spatialReference":{"latestWkid":3857,"wkid":102100},"x":-10440277.813215928,"y":6452361.80662533},"zoom":9,"viewpoint":{"rotation":0,"scale":1155581.108577,"targetGeometry":{"spatialReference":{"latestWkid":3857,"wkid":102100},"x":-10440277.813215928,"y":6452361.80662533}}}},"n-P6eJ0Z":{"type":"immersive-slide","data":{"transition":"fade"},"children":["n-f20y8q","n-V6coxV"]},"n-2A03QR":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"The mercury contaminated the water and poisoned the fish as well as the people from these communities who relied on the fish as a staple in their diet.

However, ending the long-term drinking water advisories and making progress towards the provision of safe drinking water in First Nations communities requires more than additional funding or technical and infrastructural interventions. Literature suggests that the water crisis in First Nations communities is reflective of a host of unresolved issues related to inequity, justice, and institutional trends, resulting in impacts that go beyond physical illness to affect the social, cultural, and spiritual health of First Nations in Canada (Basdeo and Bharadwaj, 2013). Therefore, water issues should not be addressed in isolation. There are growing calls for the government to expand its efforts from a focus on monetary investments on water and wastewater infrastructures towards a broader, more holistic approach that addresses issues related to water regulation as well as the underlying social, economic, and environmental factors that affect water provision, safety, and quality (e.g., housing, operator training and retention, and source water protection). It is also important to acknowledge that identifying and implementing sustainable solutions to safe drinking water in First Nations communities will require the government to engage in more reconciliatory acts with First Nations communities to develop long-term strategies that respect Indigenous knowledge and address the specific needs of each community to ensure reliable access to safe drinking water.","type":"paragraph"}},"n-RAU7Wa":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"","type":"paragraph"}},"n-pqVjRl":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"Reference","type":"h4"}},"n-hSp4sT":{"type":"text","data":{"text":"Baijius, W., Patrick, R.
